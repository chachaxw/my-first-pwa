# My first Progressive Web App Code Lab

These are the resource files needed for the [Your first Progressive Web App](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/your-first-pwapp/)
code lab from Google.

This is a work in progress, if you find a mistake, please [file an issue](https://github.com/googlecodelabs/your-first-pwapp/issues). Thanks!

## What you’ll learn
* How to design and construct an app using the “app shell” method
* How to make your app work offline
* How to store data for use offline later

## What you’ll need
* Chrome 52 or above, though any browser that supports service workers and `cache.addAll()` will work
* [Web Server for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb), or use your own web server of choice.
* The [sample code](https://github.com/googlecodelabs/your-first-pwapp/archive/master.zip)
* A text editor
* Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript
* (Optional) Node is required in the last step to deploy to Firebase

## What is a Progressive Web App?
A Progressive Web App is:
* Progressive - Works for every user, regardless of browser choice because it's built with progressive enhancement as a core tenet.
* Responsive - Fits any form factor: desktop, mobile, tablet, or whatever is next.
* Connectivity independent - Enhanced with service workers to work offline or on low-quality networks.
* App-like - Feels like an app to the user with app-style interactions and navigation because it's built on the app shell model.
* Fresh - Always up-to-date thanks to the service worker update process.
* Safe - Served via HTTPS to prevent snooping and to ensure content hasn't been tampered with.
* Discoverable - Is identifiable as an "application" thanks to W3C manifest and service worker registration scope, allowing search engines to find it.
* Re-engageable - Makes re-engagement easy through features like push notifications.
* Installable - Allows users to "keep" apps they find most useful on their home screen without the hassle of an app store.
* Linkable - Easily share via URL, does not require complex installation.
